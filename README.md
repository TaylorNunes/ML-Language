# ML-Language
A machine learning repository as it relates to language and NLP

## Purpose 
The goal of this repository was to familiarize myself with machine learning concepts, both traditional and deep learning. 

For traditional machine learning concepts I trained a language classifier to differentiate English and Japanese **phonetic text** based on latin character frequency. See the directory <text>

For deep learning I trained a language classifier to differentiate English and Japanese **audio** by converting audio segments to mel spectrograms and using a convolutional neural network. See the directory <audio>
